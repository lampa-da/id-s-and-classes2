Putting it all together
Well done! You're doing great.

Now it's time to put all our newfound knowledge together:

Instructions
Check out the text in the editor to the right. On the HTML tab:

Give the h2 header an ID of "intro".
Give the first h3 and first p a class of "standout". Don't do anything to the second h3 and p!
On the CSS tab:

Inside the #intro selector, set color to #B83C3A.
Inside the .standout selector, set color to #F7AC5F and font-family to Verdana.
